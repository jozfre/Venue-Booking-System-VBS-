# Venue-Booking-System-VBS-
This is a JAVA, Object-Oriented Program (OOP) where it can cater to the booking process for the staff, student and non-UiTM organisation/person to book a venue for their respected events.  This program will accept the booking type (staff,student etc...), person and event details. Also the total charge will be handled by functions that have been implemented with the respected rate per hour of each venue that has been presented.
